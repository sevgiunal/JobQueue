# JobQueue

# ðŸ§µ Inter-Process Priority Job Queue System

This project implements a **priority job queue system** for managing jobs between processes using shared memory and semaphores. It provides multiple layers of abstraction, including low-level job structures, job queues, and synchronized access with IPC and semaphores.
